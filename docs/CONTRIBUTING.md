# Contributing to Dexter

## Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing to Dexter. I'm open to any feature enchancements for Dexter as well as bug fixes. However Dexter's primary purpose is a learning tool for me to get better with Python, so expect questions so I can understand what is being added or changed and why. With that simple caveat out of the way, welcome.

## Code of Conduct

I'm going to stick with the tried and true *Don't be a dick* code of conduct until such a time that that doesn't cover things.

## Important Resources

There's not much going on here yet, so the below docs should cover you unless you want to add features. If you have any questions or want to know more, join the Discord.
